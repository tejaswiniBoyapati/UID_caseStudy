                        <h3><b>Create Depth</b></h3>
                <p>When you are taking a landscape photograph, try creating a sense of depth by keeping all the different elements of the image in focus.

                  To do this you need to use a small aperture, from f/16-f/22 because this keeps objects in the foreground and background sharp. Place your camera on a tripod (this will eliminate camera shake) when using a small aperture, as less light will be entering the lens.</p>
                <h3><b>Use a Wide-Angle Lens</b></h3>
                <p>Wide-angle lenses are preferred for landscape photography because they can show a broader view, and therefore give a sense of wide open space.

                  They also tend to give a greater depth of field and allow you to use faster shutter speeds because they allow more light. Taking an image at f/16 will make both the foreground and background sharp.
                  
                  Remember to try some interesting angles with the photograph.</p>
                <h3><b>Use Water as a Mirror</b></h3>
                <p>Water in subdued light can create beautiful effects and reflections.

                  The best time for this kind of shot is during the two “golden hours” which are the first hour after sunrise and the last hour before sunset. Put your camera on a tripod and set the mode dial to TV or S (Shutter-Priority) mode. Choose a slow shutter speed and allow the camera to choose the correct aperture.
                  
                  If you struggle to get a sharp image you can push the ISO up although ISO 125 is a good starting point.</p>

                        <h3><b>Take candid shots</b></h3>
              <p>Getting subjects to pose can sometimes give less than optimal results. Some people are just not comfortable posing. This discomfort is particularly apparent in child portrait photography where posed portraiture images can come off as forced and unnatural.

                Getting your subjects comfortable and shooting them doing their usual, natural activities can yield fantastic portrait shots.</p>
                <h3><b>Fill the Frame</b></h3>
                <p>Filling the frame in portrait photography adds instant impact to an image by reducing the ability for the viewer’s eyes to stray. Instead, your subject becomes the main focus of the shot. For most typical portraits, filling the frame can also create a sense of intimacy. There is nothing else to look at apart from your subject’s face, so the viewer is immediately drawn into the most important part of the image – the eyes. By taking in the subject’s expression with the interplay of shadows and light, the viewer is able to immediately get a feeling for what the image is trying to convey.</p>
                <h3><b>Subject Placement</b></h3>
                <p>When figuring out where to place a subject in a portrait, many photographers find it difficult to move beyond the Rule of Thirds. Some even find it hard to think about placing the subject anywhere else but front and centre in the shot. Rather than thinking about where you place your subject, think instead about how you will fill the frame with their most important features. If you will be shooting more than just their face and would like to have their entire body in the shot, then think about how the background and their posture will affect the overall image.</p>

                    <div class="contents">
                        <h3><b>Shoot at a Lower F-Stop</b></h3>
                  <p>The aperture (hole or gap that allows for light to enter) is measured by the f-stop. The lower the f-stop, the wider the opening and the more light enters. Imagine the pupil in your eye. It widens and dilates in lower lit situations to compensate for seeing in the dark better. Choose a lens that can shoot wide open at an f/1.2-f/2.8. Choosing fast lenses like the Canon EF 50mm f/1.2 or the Zeiss CP.2 85mm T 1.5 EF Mount Speed Lens can assist with shooting at faster “speeds”.</p>
                  <h3><b>Shoot at a Higher ISO</b></h3>
                  <p>If you’re shooting with a full frame DSLR camera (like the Canon 5D Mark III, Canon 5D Mark IV, Canon 5Ds R, Nikon D810, Nikon D610, Canon 6D) you can usually push your ISO up to 3200 without seeing any grain. On a crop sensor body, limitations usually sit at 1600 ISO. Of course, every situation is different and if you feel you can still bump up the ISO past these numbers without getting grain, by all means do so to get the look you want. We recommend experimenting with different settings to get what you’re most happy with.</p>

                        <h3><b>Who is your target audience?</b></h3>
                    <p>The answer to this question will inform everything you do, from any creative requirements (length / visual style / pace etc.), all the way to whether you should create a video at all. The due diligence of considering your audience and how they prefer to consume content not only facilitates great user experiences, but also the most productive use of your time when creating content.</p>
                    <h3><b>What is your message?</b></h3>
                    <p>A.k.a. “Describe it to me in one sentence”. What’s the one thing you want people to take away from your video? And it needs to be one thing – the most common error is communicating too many messages, which results in videos without focus. And the best way to communicate that message is to use the 3-10-30 rule: hook people in the first 3 seconds, set the scene in the first 10 seconds (e.g. “Today, we’ll talk about…”) and communicate your single key message in the first 30 seconds. The remainder of your video can be used for adding further value/messages, then for the conclusion.</p>

                        <h3><b>Adjusting Contrast</b></h3>
                        <p>Adjusting contrast can have various effects. Increasing contrast in a photo can make it appear sharper or more dramatic. Decreasing contrast can give photos a faded effect reminiscent of film stock.

                            No matter what effect you are going for, you can achieve it by adjusting the contrast setting. Simply adjust the contrast slider and see what style you like more for your image.
                            
                            An advanced technique to selectively increase or reduce contrast in your image is using tone curves. Tonal curves are basically a tool that allows you to adjust the brightness of select areas of your image from shadows to midtones to highlights. By doing so, it also adjusts the contrast selectively in an image. </p>
                        <h3><b>Adjusting Colors</b></h3>
                        <p>By dealing with color we mean adjusting the intensity of color in your shot.

                            Both the vibrancy adjustment and saturation adjustment manipulate the intensity of color in an image. Where they differ, however, is in which colors they intensify. Having a basic understanding of color theory will also help you decide on how you want color to help tell the story. Saturation increases the intensity of all colors in an image. Vibrancy, on the other hand, increases the intensity of muted tones and colors and aims to protect skin tones.

                            If you are looking to manipulate the actual color of an image to try and utilize color theory in your shot, you can utilize HSL adjustments (hue, saturation, and lightness) and selective color adjustments. </p>

                        <h3><b>Obey the 321 Rule</b></h3>
                        <p>Just like woodworkers learn from the start to measure twice and cut once, video editors using any program should practice the 321 rule. Keep three copies of everything you create, in at least two different places, with one of those places physically separated from your other locations. </p>
                        <h3><b>Adding Text and Graphics</b></h3>
                        <p>Depending on your film type, you may have to include more text aside from the title, opening/closing billboards (for broadcasting), and film credits. You’ll usually want to keep it simple, with a clean and white sans-serif font that doesn’t grab too much attention. Have them dissolve in and out, and see how it works for your film.

                            But if you need to add flashy graphics, you can create them using your editing software. Adobe After Effects is a popular choice for creating some of the best motion graphics. If you’ve yet to learn how to make your own by hand, you can always get impressive ready-made After Effects templates from RocketStock.</p>
